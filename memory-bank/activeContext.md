## Previous Work: Clinical Accuracy & Robustness

 Addressed critical scoring discrepancies and improved clinical depth for "Pores" analysis.

 ### Key Achievements:
 1. **Fixed Scoring Bug:** Resolved an issue where the AI was outputting 0-1 scores for concern cards while using 1-5 for radars. Added strict Pydantic validation (`ge=1.0`, `le=5.0`) to `scripts/skin_lib.py` to transparently enforce the correct scale at the schema level.
 2. **Clinical Pores Analysis:** Updated `prompts/01_analyse_images_6_photos_prompt.md` to use dermatological morphology for pores:
    *   **O-shaped:** Sebum-related (T-zone).
    *   **U-shaped:** Aging/Elastosis-related.
    *   **Y-shaped:** Scarring/Acne-related.
    *   Added relevant clinical citations to the prompt.

 ## Previous Work: Deployment Readiness & Plumbing

 Implemented robust environment management and storage access for the AI analysis pipeline to ensure reliability across global deployments.

 ### Key Achievements:
 1. **Dev/Prod Mode:** Added `--env` flag to analysis scripts (`dev` vs `prod`) to safely switch between `user-uploads-dev` and `user-uploads` buckets.
 2. **S3 Fallback Strategy:** Implemented a direct S3 access layer using `boto3` to bypass Supabase RLS policies during backend processing.
 3. **Timestamped Storage:** Upgraded the upload pipeline to store images in time-partitioned folders (`userId/timestamp/filename`) for better organization and versioning.
 4. **UI Polish (Border Colors):** Fixed incorrect border colors in light mode.
