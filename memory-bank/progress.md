# Progress

## What Works

*   The `lila.skin/guidelines` page has been created with content and styling from the Figma design.
*   The basic Next.js application is set up and running.
*   The initial file structure is in place.
*   A detailed, nested data structure for skin analysis has been defined in `radhika.json`.
*   The `UserProfile` component now displays a larger profile picture and the user's name.

## What's Left to Build

*   Refactor all UI components to align with the new data structure.
*   User authentication.
*   User profile creation and management.
*   Skin analysis functionality.
*   Product recommendation engine.
*   Progress tracking and visualization.

## Known Issues

*   The UI is currently out of sync with the data model and requires a full refactor.
*   The application may be experiencing caching issues that prevent the latest data from being displayed.
