# Progress

## What Works

*   **Database Integration:** The application is now fully integrated with a Supabase (PostgreSQL) database, replacing the local JSON file system.
*   **Data Migration:** Product, user, and skin analysis data has been successfully migrated to the database.
*   **Frontend Refactoring:** The entire frontend has been refactored to fetch data from Supabase using a server-side client.
*   **Next.js 16 Upgrade:** The application has been upgraded to Next.js 16, including the migration to Cache Components and the new async APIs.
*   **Modular AI Scripts:** The AI-powered skin analysis and recommendation functionality is split into a modular, maintainable pipeline.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard:** The user dashboard at `/dashboard/[userId]` is now fully dynamic, rendering data from the database for each user.
*   **Project Management:** Implemented GitHub MCP integration to manage project backlog and tasks using GitHub Issues.
