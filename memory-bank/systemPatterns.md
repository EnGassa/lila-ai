# System Patterns

## Architecture

*   **Frontend:** A Next.js application using TypeScript and React.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for styling, with a component library for UI elements.
*   **State Management:** React Context or a similar lightweight state management solution.
*   **Data Fetching:** SWR or React Query for data fetching and caching.

## Key Technical Decisions

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI will be built using a modular, component-based architecture to promote reusability and maintainability.
*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js will be used for its SSR capabilities to improve performance and SEO.
*   **API Integration:** The application will communicate with a backend API to fetch data and perform user-specific actions.
