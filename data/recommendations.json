  "general_advice": [
    "Sunscreen is your most important step. Because your concerns include pigmentation and sun spots, daily use of a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher is essential to see results and prevent new spots from forming. Apply it every morning as the last step of your routine.",
    "Introduce new active ingredients slowly. The Retinol pads should be used only 2-3 times per week at first. Pay attention to how your skin responds before increasing the frequency to avoid irritation.",
    "Consistency is key for visible results. It can take 8-12 weeks of consistent use to notice improvements in pigmentation and pore appearance. Stick with the routine to see the best results.",
    "Be gentle with the eye area. When applying products, gently pat them around the orbital bone. The ingredients in your treatment serums can help with the brownish pigmentation under your eyes, but they will not affect the darkness caused by the natural hollow structure."
