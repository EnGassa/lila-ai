  "general_advice": [
    "Sunscreen is non-negotiable. Your routine focuses on treating pigmentation, but this will be ineffective without daily sun protection. Since no sunscreen was provided in the product list, it is crucial that you use a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every single morning and reapply every two hours if you are outdoors.",
    "Consistency is your best friend. It can take at least 8-12 weeks of consistent use to see noticeable improvements in pigmentation and under-eye darkening. Stick with the routine to see results.",
    "Introduce new active ingredients slowly. The Vitamin C serum is potent. Start by using it just 2-3 times per week in the morning, gradually increasing to daily use as your skin tolerates it to avoid irritation.",
    "Listen to your skin. The structural component of your under-eye circles may not fully resolve with topical products alone. If this remains a significant concern after several months, consider consulting a dermatologist to discuss other available options.",
    "Don't forget a moisturizer. While this routine provides excellent hydration through toners and ampoules, you would benefit from adding a dedicated moisturizer for combination skin at the end of your PM routine to lock everything in and support your skin barrier."
