  "reasoning": "**Step 1 (Audit & Philosophy Alignment):** My primary directive is to execute the Skincare Philosophy, which targets Pigmentation, Pores, and Under-Eye concerns using Vitamin C, Retinoid, BHA, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, and Azelaic Acid. I first audited the provided product list. The list contains excellent candidates for Vitamin C, Retinoid, BHA, Niacinamide, and Hyaluronic Acid. However, I identified a gap: no product contained Azelaic Acid in its `matched_key_ingredients`, so I will proceed without it, relying on the other actives to address pigmentation. For BHA, the only product that matched the key ingredient was a cleanser (`jumiso/all-day-vitamin-clean-mild-facial-cleanser`), which is unconventional for an exfoliant but necessary to follow the rules.\\n\\n**Step 2 (Hero Product Selection & Skin Cycling):** Based on the AM (Protect & Brighten) and PM (Treat & Renew) focuses, I selected the \"hero\" products.\\n- **AM Vitamin C:** I chose the `needly/vita-c-glow-jelly-pad` as the primary brightening step.\\n- **PM Retinoid:** The `la-roche-posay/retinol-b3-serum` was the clear choice, as it contains both the required Retinoid and Niacinamide.\\n- **PM BHA:** The `jumiso/all-day-vitamin-clean-mild-facial-cleanser` was selected to fulfill the BHA requirement for pores.\\nTo ensure safety and prevent over-exfoliation, I structured the PM routine around a \"Skin Cycling\" schedule. The BHA Cleanser and Retinoid Serum are used on separate, alternating nights, with \"Recovery\" nights in between that focus solely on hydration and barrier repair.\\n\\n**Step 3 (Building the Supporting Routine & Safety Checks):** I built the rest of the routine around these core actives.\\n- **Cleanser:** I selected the gentle `anua/8-hyaluronic-acid-hydrating-gentle-foaming-cleanser` for daily use to avoid stripping the skin, adhering to the \"ingredients_to_avoid\" rule. The BHA cleanser is used *only* on exfoliation nights.\\n- **Moisturizer & Sunscreen:** I chose the `purito/b5-panthenol-re-barrier-cream` and `round-lab/birch-juice-moisturizing-sunscreen-spf-50` for their hydrating and supportive ingredients (Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid), which are used daily to maintain skin health.\\n- **Eye Cream:** The top concern is under-eyes. I selected the `cosrx/advanced-snail-peptide-eye-cream` for its blend of Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid to target both pigmentation and structural hollows safely in both AM and PM routines.\\n\\n**Step 4 (Final Polish):** I reviewed the complete routine against all clinical safety rules. The alternating schedule prevents Retinoid and BHA from being used together. Vitamin C is correctly placed in the AM. Core steps (Cleanser, Moisturizer, Sunscreen) are identified, and treatment steps are marked as optional for a minimal routine. The instructions clearly outline the weekly schedule.",
