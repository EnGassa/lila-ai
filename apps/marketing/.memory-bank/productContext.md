# Product Context

## Problem Statement
The skincare market is saturated with marketing hype and confusing jargon. Users struggle to find products that actually work for their specific skin type and often rely on trial and error.

## Solution
Lila offers a data-driven approach:
-   **Computer Vision**: Maps the face and identifies distinct variables (barrier health, texture, etc.).
-   **Science-Backed Logic**: Explains *why* specific ingredients work using clinical rigour.
-   **Curated Routine**: specific product recommendations.

## Experience Goals
-   **Premium & Trustworthy**: The design language (fonts like KoHo and Playfair Display, color palette) conveys sophistication and medical-grade accuracy without being sterile.
-   **Fluid & Responsive**: High-quality animations (Framer Motion, CSS animations) make the site feel "alive" and modern.
-   **Simplicity**: Complex technology is presented in simple, understandable steps (Analyze -> Understand -> Transform).
