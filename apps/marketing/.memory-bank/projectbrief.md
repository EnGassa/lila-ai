# Project Brief: Lila Marketing Website

## Overview
Lila is a skincare marketing website built to promote a mobile application that transforms a phone into a skin consultant. The website serves as the primary landing page to educate users about the "Lila" technology (AI-based skin analysis), showcase "How it Works", and drive user acquisition through a "Get Started" call-to-action (currently a waitlist/analysis form).

## Core Objectives
1.  **Brand Presence**: Establishes Lila as a premium, science-backed skincare solution using high-quality aesthetics and clear messaging.
2.  **User Education**: Explains the three-step process: Analyze, Understand, and Transform.
3.  **Lead Generation**: Captures user interest via Tally forms embedded for "Free Analysis".

## Key Features
-   **Hero Section**: Engaging animations and value proposition.
-   **Interactive "How it Works"**: Dynamic phone mockup switching screens based on user selection.
-   **Testimonials**: Carousel of user feedback.
-   **Waitlist/Analysis Form**: Embedded Tally form for user intake.

## Related Repositories
-   **Main Application**: `../lila-ai-web` (Contains Admin UI, Dashboard, Python Analysis Scripts, Auth, etc.)
    *   *Note: This repository (`lila-website`) is strictly for the public-facing marketing landing page.*
