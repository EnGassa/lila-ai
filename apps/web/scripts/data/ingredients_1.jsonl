{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/benzophenone-3","name":"Benzophenone-3","description":"You probably know this ingredient as Oxybenzone, a sunscreen ingredient. It is a broad-spectrum sunscreen ingredient, meaning it can protect the skin against UVB and short UVA rays. The absorption range is 270-350 nm with peak absorption at 288 and 350 nm. This chemical ingredient protects your skin by using chemical reactions to convert UV rays into heat and energy. UV absorbers may absorb both UVA and UVB rays. It is often combined with other sunscreen ingredients to help with stability. Ongoing research is looking into whether oxybenzone causes skin irritation and sensitivity. However, it has been shown to trigger contact dermatitis in some studies. Oxybenzone is allowed in certain concentrations by many countries. It is allowed up to 6% in the US, and Canada, 5% in Japan, and 10% in Australia. Other countries and regions of the US have banned this ingredient to protect coral reefs and marine ecosystems. These places include Hawaii, Key West, US Virgin Islands, marine parks in Thailand, Aruba, and Palau. The EU currently allows the following maximum concentrations: Studies show conflicting results about oxybenzone being absorbed into the human body. The Swedish Research Institute has advised careful use of this ingredient by pregnant women and children.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid","name":"Salicylic Acid","description":"Salicylic Acid (also known as beta hydroxy acid or BHA) is a well-known ingredient for treating skin that struggles with acne and clogged pores. It exfoliates both the skin's surface and deep within the pores to help clear out buildup, control oil, and reduce inflammation. Unlike AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids), salicylic acid is oil-soluble. This allows it to penetrate into pores which makes it especially effective for treating blackheads and preventing future breakouts. Salicylic acid is also known for its soothing properties. It has a similar structure to aspirin and can calm inflamed or irritated skin, making it a good option for acne-prone skin that is also sensitive. Concentrations of 0.5-2% are recognized by the U.S. FDA as an over-the-counter topical acne product. It can cause irritation and/or dryness if one's skin already has a compromised moisture barrier, so it's best to focus on repairing that before introducing this ingredient into your routine. While salicylic acid does not increase sun sensitivity, it’s still important to wear sunscreen daily to protect your skin.

Retinoids are the superstar class of anti-aging ingredients that include tretinoin and retinol. This particular ingredient has had a bumpy year with its rise and fall in popularity. First, Retinyl palmitate is created from palmitic acid and retinol. It is a retinol ester and considered one of the weaker forms of retinoid. This is because all retinoids have to be converted to Tretinoin, AKA retinoic acid. Retinyl Palmitate is pretty far down the line and has to go through multiple conversions before its effects are seen. Due to this long and ineffective conversion line, the benefits of Retinyl Palmitate are debated. Studies show Retinyl Palmitate to help: Dermatologists say this ingredient is ineffective because it isn't used in high enough concentrations in cosmetics. This ingredient used to be found in sunscreens to boost the efficacy of sunscreen filters. The downfall of Retinyl Palmitate was due to released reports about the ingredient being correlated to sun damage and skin tumors. While there is a study showing this ingredient to cause DNA damage when exposed to UV-A, there is no concrete proof of it being linked to skin cancer. It is safe to use when used correctly. All retinoids increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun in the first few months of usage. Be especially careful with reapplying sunscreen when using any form of retinoid. Currently, this ingredient is still allowed in cosmetics all over the world. In Canada, cosmetics must have a warning label stating the product to contain Retinyl Palmitate Fun fact: This ingredient is often added to low-fat milk to increase the levels of Vitamin A.","tags":[{"name":"Retinoid","description":"Retinoids (AKA Vitamin A) help with signs of aging by simulating new cell production and getting rid of old skin cells."},{"name":"Acne Fighter","description":"Some ingredients target acne through different mechanisms: killing bacteria, unclogging pores, or reducing oil production.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane","name":"Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane","description":"Also known as Avobenzone, this ingredient is a chemical sunscreen filter that provides protection in the UV-A range. Avobenzone is globally approved and is the most commonly used UV-A filter in the world. Studies have found that avobenzone becomes ineffective when exposed to UV light (it is not photostable; meaning that it breaks down in sunlight). Because of this, formulations that include avobenzone will usually contain stabilizers such as octocrylene.

Soybean oil is an emollient. It is rich in antioxidants and fatty acids including palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids. As an emollient, the fatty acids in soybean oil helps keep your skin soft and hydrated. It does so by creating a film on top that traps moisture in. Soybean oil is also rich in vitamin E, a potent antioxidant. Vitamin E is also anti-inflammatory and provides a soothing effect. Studies show soy may help fade hyperpigmentation from UVB. It does so by disrupting the melanin process from UVB induced skin inflammation. This ingredient may not be malassezia folliculitis, or fungal-acne, safe.

Another benefit is a bit of UV protection. Vitamin E helps reduce the damage caused by UVB rays. (It should not replace your sunscreen). Combining it with Vitamin C can decrease sunburned cells and hyperpigmentation after UV exposure. You might have noticed Vitamin E + C often paired together. This is because it is great at stabilizing Vitamin C. Using the two together helps increase the effectiveness of both ingredients.

Panthenol is famous due to its ability to go deeper into the skin's layers. Using this ingredient has numerous pros (and no cons): Like hyaluronic acid, panthenol is a humectant. Humectants are able to bind and hold large amounts of water to keep skin hydrated. This ingredient works well for wound healing. It works by increasing tissue in the wound and helps close open wounds. Once oxidized, panthenol converts to pantothenic acid. Panthothenic acid is found in all living cells.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-extract","name":"Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract","description":"Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract is an extract of the leaves of the aloe, Aloe barbadensis, Liliaceae. Aloe is one of the most well-known natural soothing ingredients, and for good reason. It’s full of water and has a cooling, calming effect on the skin, especially when it’s sunburned, itchy, or irritated. Aloe also helps your skin stay hydrated and smooth by mimicking what healthy skin naturally produces. On top of that, it contains vitamins and nutrients that support skin recovery. It doesn’t protect you from the sun, but it can help your skin bounce back after too much time in it. Let’s get into the details: Aloe contains antioxidant Vitamins A, C, and E, which help fight off free radicals (unstable molecules from things like pollution that can damage your skin). It’s also rich in polysaccharides, which are natural sugars that help hydrate the skin by acting like the skin’s own moisturizing agents. These, along with other sugars like monosaccharides, help form a protective barrier that locks in moisture. Aloe works as both a humectant and an emollient. That means it draws water into the skin (humectant) and helps trap it there (emollient), making it an effective natural moisturizer. You’ll also find a mix of other skin-supporting ingredients in aloe, including folic acid, choline, calcium, amino acids, fatty acids, and even Vitamin B12. Out of the 420+ species of aloe, Aloe barbadensis is the most widely used in skincare products thanks to its gentle yet effective properties. There are over 420 species of aloe but Aloe Barbadensis is the most commonly used for topical products.","tags":[{"name":"Hydrating","description":"Some ingredients help hydrate the skin by either drawing in moisture or preventing it from escaping.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/lactic-acid","name":"Lactic Acid","description":"Lactic Acid is another well-loved alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). It is gentler than glycolic acid but still highly effective. Its main role is to exfoliate the surface of the skin by loosening the “glue” that holds dead skin cells together. Shedding those old cells leads to smoother, softer, and more even-toned skin. Because lactic acid molecules are larger than glycolic acid, they don’t penetrate as deeply. This means they’re less likely to sting or irritate, making it a great choice for beginners or those with sensitive skin. Like glycolic acid, it can: Lactic acid also acts as a humectant (like hyaluronic acid). It can draw water into the skin to improve hydration and also plays a role in the skin's natural moisturizing factor (NMF) in the form of sodium lactate. Studies show it can boost ceramide production to strengthen the skin barrier and even help balance the skin’s microbiome. To get results, choose products with a pH between 3-4. Lower strengths (5-12%) focus on surface exfoliation; higher strengths (12% and up) can reach deeper in the dermis (deeper, supportive layer) to improve skin texture and firmness over time. Though it was originally derived from milk, most modern lactic acid used in skincare is vegan. It is made through non-dairy fermentation to create a bio-identical and stable form suitable for all formulations. When lactic acid shows up near the end of an ingredient list, it usually means the brand added just a tiny amount to adjust the product’s pH. Legend has it that Cleopatra used to bathe in sour milk to help reduce wrinkles. Lactic acid is truly a gentle multitasker: it exfoliates, hydrates, strengthens, and brightens. It's a great ingredient for giving your skin a smooth, glowing, and healthy look without the harshness of stronger acids.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/panax-ginseng-root-extract","name":"Panax Ginseng Root Extract","description":"Ginseng root is a well-loved ingredient in Asian skincare for good reason. It hydrates the skin, soothes irritation, and helps even out skin tone. In traditional East Asian medicine, ginseng has been used for centuries both as food and as a healing remedy, and modern research continues to confirm its skin benefits. One of the standout features of ginseng is its ability to improve blood circulation and oxygen delivery to the skin, bringing a fresh supply of nutrients to support overall skin health. It also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This helps to protect your skin against damage from UV exposure, pollution, and daily stress. Additionally, studies suggest that ginseng may help reduce hyperpigmentation by inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme involved in melanin production. There are different types of ginseng used in skincare, and while they all share core benefits, their potency can vary. Most products use fresh or white ginseng because it’s more affordable. However, red ginseng, produced by steaming the root, contains higher levels of ginsenosides, which are compounds with proven anti-aging effects. These ginsenosides help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and improve skin elasticity. Note: All forms of ginseng are listed simply as “Panax ginseng” in ingredient lists. We recommend reaching out to the brand if you have questions about which type of ginseng is used in their ingredients. For general antioxidant benefits, any ginseng extract will do, but for wrinkle care or firmer skin, red or fermented ginseng is often more effective. In short, ginseng is a powerhouse ingredient that supports hydration, radiance, and resilience.","tags":[{"name":"Hydrating","description":"Some ingredients help hydrate the skin by either drawing in moisture or preventing it from escaping.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/niacinamide","name":"Niacinamide","description":"Niacinamide is a multitasking form of vitamin B3 that strengthens the skin barrier, reduces pores and dark spots, regulates oil, and improves signs of aging. And the best part? It's gentle and well-tolerated by most skin types, including sensitive and reactive skin. You might have heard of \"niacin flush\", or the reddening of skin that causes itchiness. Niacinamide has not been found to cause this. In very rare cases, some individuals may not be able to tolerate niacinamide at all or experience an allergic reaction to it. If you are experiencing flaking, irritation, and dryness with this ingredient, be sure to double check all your products as this ingredient can be found in all categories of skincare. When incorporating niacinamide into your routine, look out for concentration amounts. Typically, 5% niacinamide provides benefits such as fading dark spots. However, if you have sensitive skin, it is better to begin with a smaller concentration. When you apply niacinamide to your skin, your body converts it into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is an essential coenzyme that is already found in your cells as \"fuel\" and powers countless biological processes. In your skin, NAD helps repair cell damage, produce new healthy cells, support collagen production, strengthen the skin barrier, and fight environmental stressors (like UV and pollution). Our natural NAD levels start to decline with age, leading to slower skin repair, visible aging, and a weaker skin barrier. By providing your skin niacinamide, you're recharging your skin's NAD levels. This leads to stronger, healthier, and younger looking skin. Another name for vitamin B3 is nicotinamide. This vitamin is water-soluble and our bodies don't store it. We obtain Vitamin B3 from either food or skincare. Meat, fish, wheat, yeast, and leafy greens contain vitamin B3. The type of niacinamide used in skincare is synthetically created.","tags":[{"name":"Niacinamide","description":"Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) is a versatile ingredient that strengthens your skin barrier, controls oil production, and minimizes pores.

It is created by mixing ethanol with other additives. This ingredient gets a bad rep because it is irritating and drying - mostly due to its astringent property. Astringents draw out natural oils in tissue, constricting pores and leaving your skin dried out. However, alcohol denat. is not all that bad. Due to its low molecular weight, alcohol denat. tends to evaporate quickly. One study on pig skin found half of applied alcohol evaporated in 10 seconds and less than 3% stayed on skin. This also helps other ingredients become better absorbed upon application. Studies are conflicted about whether this ingredient causes skin dehydration. One study from 2005 found adding emollients to propanol-based sanitizer decreased skin dryness and irritation. Another study found irritation only occurs if your skin is already damaged. Small amounts of alcohol are generally tolerated by oily skin or people who live in humid environments. The rule of thumb is if this alcohol is near the end of an ingredients list, it will probably not affect your skin much. Also... This ingredient has antimicrobial and solvent properties.

It is internationally approved for use in sunscreens. Homosalate is not photo-stable, meaning it's strength as a UV filter degrades over time with exposure to the sun. Because of this, it's often used in combination with other chemical sunscreen filters as avobenzone (which protects from the UV-A range). Homosalate also helps act as a solvent for harder-to-dissolve UV filters. (Part of the reason that sunscreens need to be frequently re-applied is due to the photo instability of many chemical sunscreen filters) Currently, homosalate is approved in concentrations up to 10% in the EU and 15% in the US. The FDA is currently doing further research on the effects of homosalate, and it is possible that these approved concentrations will change in the future.","tags":[{"name":"UV Protection","description":"UV (Ultraviolet) ray exposure from the sun leads to skin damage; the main types of UV rays are: UV-A and UV-B."},{"name":"Chemical UV Filter","description":"Chemical UV filters are synthetic compounds that absorb and dissipate harmful UV rays, providing sun protection by converting UV radiation into heat energy."},{"name":"Bad for Coral Reefs","description":"Non-reef safe ingredients are potentially harmful to coral reefs."}],"what_it_does":[{"function":"Skin Conditioning","description":"To hydrate and soften skin"},{"function":"UV Absorber","description":"An agent that absorbs uv rays"},{"function":"UV Filter","description":"An agent that filters out certain uv rays"}],"prevalence":{"top_categories":["Sunscreens","Makeup","Moisturizers"]},"cosing_data":{"CosIng ID":"34299","INCI Name":"HOMOSALATE","INN Name":"homosalate","EC #":"204-260-8","All Functions":"Skin Conditioning, UV Absorber, UV Filter"},"references":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5615097/","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6736991/"],"user_sentiment":{"likes":"7%","avoids":"93%"}}

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/oryza-sativa-extract","name":"Oryza Sativa Extract","description":"Oryza Sativa Extract comes from the rice grain, Oryza sativa. Rice extract has wound healing, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hydrating properties. Rice grains contain numerous antioxidants which may help with anti-aging, such as vitamin E. Antioxidants help stabilize free-radical molecules. Unstable free-radical molecules may damage your skin cells and accelerate signs of aging. A study from 2002 found rice to help increase the rate of wound healing. The same study found an improvement of skin barrier function in the patients after taking rice baths. Numerous in-vitro studies have found rice water to help decrease sun damage by increasing collagen production and inhibiting the process of tyrosinase. Long story short- tyrosinase is an enzyme that controls melanin production. Our bodies start producing melanin (AKA tanning) when exposed to UV radiation to protect against damage. Rice water is found to partially block this process. Though more research is needed on rice's ability to help with UV protection, recent studies seem promising. Wondering why rice is hydrating? The protein in rice have emollient properties. Emollients create a barrier on the skin to trap moisture in, keeping your skin moisturized. Some rice extract may have mildly-exfoliating properties. These are mainly limited to Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran and Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Powder. This rice was first cultivated in China over 10,000 years ago. Many cultures throughout Asia have used rice water on skin and hair for centuries.","tags":[{"name":"Helps with Anti-Aging","description":"Aging skin results from decreased collagen production, sun damage, and slower cell turnover.

It is native to Italy. This ingredient is used to add fragrance to products. It contains limonene, linalool, and linalyl acetate. The term 'fragrance' is not regulated in many countries. In many cases, it is up to the brand to define this term. For instance, many brands choose to label themselves as \"fragrance-free\" because they are not using synthetic fragrances. However, their products may still contain ingredients such as essential oils that are considered a fragrance. When used topically, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Fruit Oil is a photosensitizer due to its furanocoumarins. Photosensitizers make the skin and eyes much more sensitive to sunlight. Photosensitizers are linked to skin cancer. However, more cosmetics using Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Fruit Oil are removing the furanocoumarins.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/linoleic-acid","name":"Linoleic Acid","description":"Linoleic Acid is also known as Vitamin F. It is a fatty acid with emollient and skin conditioning properties. Our top layer of skin, or epidermis, contains high amounts of linoleic acid naturally. Your body uses linoleic acid to build ceramides and prostaglandins. Ceramides keep your skin's barrier hydrated and strong while prosaglandins help control inflammation and healing. Needless to say, linoleic acid is crucial for having a strong skin barrier. One study found applying linoleic acid rich sunflower oil to be more effective at repairing the skin barrier than oleic rich olive oil. Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid, meaning our bodies cannot create it on its own. We need to get linoleic acid through foods such as nuts and vegetable oils. Acne-prone skin tends to have linoleic acid and high levels of oleic acid. Linoleic acid can also help treat acne by softening sebum to prevent clogged pores. Another study found using 2.5% linoleic acid gel for 4 weeks showed a 25% reduction in small comedones. This ingredient can also help lighten hyperpigmentation or sun spots by disrupting the melanin production process. It also helps your skin shed melanin pigment from your skin caused by UV exposure. Due to its role in the production of the fatty acid prostaglandin, linoleic acid can also help reduce inflammation and support wound healing. Linoleic acid is not always fungal-acne safe; it may trigger flare-ups in sensitive individuals.","tags":[{"name":"Acne Fighter","description":"Some ingredients target acne through different mechanisms: killing bacteria, unclogging pores, or reducing oil production.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate","name":"Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate","description":"Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate (THD) is a stable and oil-soluble form of Vitamin C. THD is special in that it has the ability to travel deeper into skin than traditional ascorbic acid while maintaining the same skin benefits (double win!). Because it’s oil-soluble, THD dives deep into your skin’s fatty layers (think ceramides and cholesterol) to fight off the kind of free radicals that mess with your skin barrier. This makes it a great pair with water-based vitamin C (ascorbic acid) that mainly works on the surface. Even at just 0.1%, THD is already showing great antioxidant activity. When used up to 2%, it helps keep your skin happy and calm, especially when it’s stressed from pollution or sun. Want to fade dark spots or tackle hyperpigmentation? You’ll want 5% or more. Pairing it with brightening buddies like niacinamide or licorice root gives even better results. One study even used 30% THD with other brighteners and saw real results on stubborn discoloration, even in melasma-prone skin. A note on THD: It’s has a slightly silky, oily texture and usually shows up colorless or pale yellow (though the exact shade can vary by supplier). While you can sneak it into water-based formulas, it really shines when paired with silicones or oils, which help your skin soak it up better. THD is pretty stable, but it’s still vulnerable to degradation like ascorbic acid. Too much light or heat (above 113°F / 45°C) can break it down over time.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/titanium-dioxide","name":"Titanium Dioxide","description":"Titanium dioxide is a mineral UV filter widely used in sunscreens and cosmetics. It is one of only two UV filters officially classified as “mineral” by regulatory agencies, the other being zinc oxide. Titanium dioxide provides broad-spectrum protection mostly in the UVB and UVAII range, with some protection in the UVAI range. While its UVA protection isn’t as strong as zinc oxide’s, the difference is minor. A common myth is that mineral UV filters reflect UV light. However, modern research shows titanium dioxide absorbs UV radiation like chemical filters (~95% absorption & 5% reflection). Thanks to its non-irritating nature, titanium dioxide is suitable for sensitive, acne-prone, or redness-prone skin. It is unlikely to cause \"eye sting\" like other sunscreen ingredients. A major drawback of this ingredient is its white cast and thick texture. This is why mineral sunscreens often leave a white cast and are less cosmetically elegant than chemical/hybrid sunscreens. To improve white cast and spreadability, micronized or nano-sized titanium dioxide is often used. There are ongoing concerns surrounding nano-titanium oxide's impact on marine ecosystems. There is no conclusive evidence that any form of titanium oxide (or any other sunscreen ingredients) will cause harm to marine ecosystems or coral reefs. The science is still developing but many consumers are keeping a close eye on this issue. Please note, many destinations have reef-safety sunscreen rules. For instance, the U.S. Virgin Islands advises all visitors to use non-nano mineral sunscreens. Nano mineral sunscreens once raised safety concerns about absorption into skin. Extensive research has shown that they do not penetrate healthy or damaged skin; they remain safely on the surface and the top layer of dead skin (stratum corneum). You'll likely find titanium dioxide bundled with alumina, silica, or dimethicone. These ingredients help make titanium dioxide highly photostable; this prevents it from interacting with other formula components under UV light.","tags":[{"name":"UV Protection","description":"UV (Ultraviolet) ray exposure from the sun leads to skin damage; the main types of UV rays are: UV-A and UV-B."},{"name":"Mineral UV Filter","description":"Mineral UV filters, also known as physical or inorganic filters, use naturally occurring minerals such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to create a protective barrier on the skin that reflects and scatters UV rays."},{"name":"Bad for Coral Reefs","description":"Non-reef safe ingredients are potentially harmful to coral reefs."}],"what_it_does":[{"function":"Cosmetic Colorant","description":"Agents that add color to a product"},{"function":"UV Absorber","description":"An agent that absorbs uv rays"},{"function":"UV Filter","description":"An agent that filters out certain uv rays"}],"prevalence":{"top_categories":["Makeup","Sunscreens","Moisturizers"]},"cosing_data":{"CosIng ID":"38617","INCI Name":"TITANIUM DIOXIDE","INN Name":"titanium dioxide","EC #":"236-675-5","Ph.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/mandelic-acid","name":"Mandelic Acid","description":"Mandelic Acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). Like other AHAs, it helps exfoliate the surface of the skin by breaking down the bonds that hold dead skin cells together. This helps reveal smoother and brighter skin underneath. Mandelic acid helps with: Due to it having a larger molecular size than glycolic acid, mandelic acid is able to penetrate the skin more slowly and evenly. This makes it gentler and less irritating, making it a great option for sensitive or beginner skin. Despite being milder, mandelic acid is still an effective exfoliant that improves skin texture and tone over time. What makes mandelic acid stand out from other AHAs? It has antibacterial and antioxidant properties. These traits make it a great option for acne-prone or problem skin by reducing active breakouts and fading post-acne marks. Studies show that mandelic acid (especially when combined with salicylic acid) can significantly reduce pimples and hyperpigmentation while causing fewer side effects than stronger acids. Mandelic acid is effective in concentrations of 5% and up with an ideal pH range of 3-4 for at-home use. Like other AHAs, it’s important to wear sunscreen daily to protect your newly exfoliated skin. However, unlike glycolic acid, mandelic acid is light-sensitive. Be sure your mandelic acid is packaged in opaque containers to ensure it stays stable and effective. In short, mandelic acid is a gentle yet powerful AHA that exfoliates, brightens, and helps clarify skin while keeping irritation low. Its antibacterial action makes it especially beneficial for those with acne-prone, sensitive, or uneven skin, offering smoother, clearer, and more even-toned results over time.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/glycolic-acid","name":"Glycolic Acid","description":"Glycolic Acid is arguably the most famous alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) with tons of research backing its benefits. It is found naturally in sugar cane but the form used in skincare is usually synthetic for purity and stability. Glycolic acid removes the top layer of dead skin cells to allow newer and fresher ones to emerge. AHAs work by breaking down the structural “glue” that holds old skin cells in place. When that buildup is gone, your skin can renew itself more efficiently. Research also shows glycolic acid stimulates collagen production, helping to firm and thicken the skin over time. This is one of its biggest advantages over other AHAs. Overall, glycolic acid helps with: Fun fact: Glycolic acid boosts skin hydration by helping it produce molecules that increase hyaluronic acid naturally. To work best, glycolic acid products should have a pH between 3-4 (that’s where exfoliation is most effective but still gentle on skin). The pH and concentration of a product are key to its effectiveness: It is normal to feel a slight stinging sensation when using glycolic acid. This usually fades as your skin adjusts. Because glycolic acid has the smallest molecular size in the AHA family, it can penetrate deeper, which enhances its effectiveness but also makes it more likely to irritate sensitive skin. If your skin is very sensitive or prone to rosacea, glycolic acid may be too strong; in that case, try milder options like lactic acid or a PHA instead. Recent studies suggest glycolic acid might even help protect against UV damage. But don’t skip sunscreen! Freshly exfoliated skin is more sensitive to the sun. Glycolic acid is a skincare superstar. It smooths, brightens, hydrates, and firms the skin. Unless you’re highly sensitive, it’s well worth adding to your routine.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/copper-tripeptide-1","name":"Copper Tripeptide-1","description":"Copper Tripeptide-1 (GHK-Cu) is a skin repairing ingredient known for its ability to boost collagen, improve firmness, and support skin regeneration. It is a complex made up of a naturally occurring peptide (glycine-histidine-lysine) and copper, an essential trace element. While studying wound healing, researchers noticed GHK-Cu stimulated hair follicle enlargement and growth by keeping hair in its active growth phase longer. This has made it a promising ingredient for hair regrowth treatments. Some people have reported increased facial hair. While GHK-Cu can make your hair follicles bigger, it usually doesn’t turn soft, barely-visible facial hairs into thick, dark ones. Anecdotal reports suggest that overusing copper peptides might lead to premature aging due to excess free copper or enzyme imbalances. This claim isn’t backed by large-scale studies. Unfortunately, there are limited human studies for this ingredient. While early results are promising, many studies are either small, in-vitro, or not rigorously controlled. For example, there is a 1998 study that explored the effects of copper tripeptide, vitamin C, tretinoin, and melatonin on skin repair and collagen synthesis. After one month, increased procollagen production was seen in 7 out of 10 participants using copper tripeptide (more than those using vitamin C, melatonin, or tretinoin. While the study was exploratory, it offers early evidence that copper tripeptide may support collagen production. Larger, well-designed trials are still needed to confirm its potential and understand individual responses.

UV absorbers protect your skin by using chemical reactions to convert UV rays into heat and energy. UVB (290-320 nm) rays emit more energy than UVA rays. They are capable of damaging DNA, causing sunburns and are thought to be linked to skin cancer. The state of Hawaii has banned sunscreens containing octinoxate due to its potential impact on coral reefs. More research is needed to bridge gaps in this research.

Emollients create a thin barrier on the skin to prevent moisture from escaping. There is ongoing debate about whether hydrolyzed collagen works because it increases skin hydration. Skin hydration is also linked to elasticity and the appearance of wrinkles. Collagen or peptide ingredients can be used in the morning or night. They will not increase sun sensitivity, but you should always wear sunscreen during the day. According to a manufacturer, this ingredient is a great hair conditioner as well. This ingredient can be extracted from different sources, including: Vegan collagen is derived from yeast, bacteria, or plant sources. Vegan collagen would go by a different INCI name, such as hydrolyzed soy protein. The results are varied. A study from 2021 found hydrolyzed collagen increased elasticity and improved wrinkles in 1,125 participants between age 20 and 70. Another study found increased skin thickness in participants between the ages of 45 to 59. However, It is difficult to prove that oral collagen will end up working on your skin. Many of the studies using hydrolyzed collagen also add several vitamins and nutrients into the test mixture as well. Further studies are needed at this time.","tags":[{"name":"Helps with Anti-Aging","description":"Aging skin results from decreased collagen production, sun damage, and slower cell turnover.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/sodium-dna","name":"Sodium Dna","description":"Sodium DNA is an emerging anti-aging ingredient. It is created by taking deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and purifying it with sodium hydroxide. The DNA is extracted from several different animal sources, including: calf thymus, the gonadic tissue of a male sturgeon, or herring / salmon sperm. You have probably seen this ingredient in anti-aging skincare. But what is it? DNA is composed of nucleotides, or chemical building blocks. Nucleotides include adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Talk about a flashback to biology! Nucleosides are formed from these nucleotides. The science behind Sodium DNA is based on an ingredient called Polydeoxyribonucleotide or PDRN. PDRN are DNA fragments mainly extracted from the sperm cells of trout or salmon. Meaning, PDRN can be derived from Sodium DNA. PDRN consists of chains of nucleotides and nucleosides mentioned above. They can range anywhere from 80 - 2000 pairs. Studies show PDRN has the following properties: Most of the research on PDRN has been done using injectable forms. That’s important, because PDRN is a large molecule and doesn’t absorb well through the skin. So if you’re applying it topically, the effects are likely to be much milder. Still, topical Sodium DNA is emerging as a trendy anti-aging ingredient. It’s generally well-tolerated and offers good biocompatibility with human skin, making it a low-risk addition to most routines. Further studies are needed to truly confirm this ingredients anti-aging ability (Remember, retinol has decades of research!). When using this ingredient, is is best to ask a brand about the source of their Sodium DNA. You'll want to find products where the Sodium DNA is sourced from fish. Some Sodium DNA is derived from calf / cow thymus. Needless to say, this ingredient is not vegan.","tags":[{"name":"Helps with Anti-Aging","description":"Aging skin results from decreased collagen production, sun damage, and slower cell turnover.

Retinal has many benefits as other retinoids: improve skin texture, reduce large pores, reduce the effects of aging, reduce the visibility of dark spots, heal scars, and fight acne. Studies show retinal may work at a faster rate than retinol due to its structure. All retinoids have to be converted into retinoic acid before starting to work. Some retinoids take several steps of conversion before binding. Retinal is only one step away, making it more potent. Like other retinoids, retinal may be irritating. It is best to ease into using this ingredient frequently. Using the 'ramp up' method, start by using retinol once a week. This gives your skin time to adjust and decrease irritation. Once you feel ready, you can slowly increase the frequency of retinol use. Using retinoids will increase sun-sensitivity in the first few weeks of use.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/ascorbic-acid","name":"Ascorbic Acid","description":"Ascorbic Acid is is pure Vitamin C. This form makes up the largest amount of vitamin C found naturally in our skin. Not only is vitamin C great for your overall health and immune system, it also has plenty of benefits on your skin. Vitamin C is best used for brightening skin. It improves dark spots, acne scars, and hyperpigmentation. This is because it blocks the process of skin darkening when exposed to UV. Remember: Vitamin C should not replace sunscreen! Your skin uses vitamin C to build collagen. Collagen is one key component in having a strong skin barrier and plump skin. Vitamin C also plays a role in regulating collagen, thus making it effective in improving wrinkles and fine lines. Ascorbic acid shows potent antioxidant activity. As an antioxidant, it helps fight free-radicals. Free-radicals are molecules that may damage your skin cells. These antioxidants also protect skin against UV damage. The best formulations include Vitamin E and/or ferulic acid. These two ingredients help stabilize and provide a boost in the benefits of ascorbic acid. This is because ascorbic acid becomes unstable when exposed to UV and air. In fact, you can tell your ascorbic acid has oxidized when it turns an orange-yellow color. Ascorbic acid is generally compatible with other ingredients. However, using ascorbic acid with other active ingredients might cause irritation. Two ingredients: copper ions and benzoyl peroxide, will inactivate ascorbic acid completely. Read more about other types of Vitamin C: Foods rich with vitamin C include oranges, strawberries, broccoli, bell peppers, and more.

This ingredient is a signal peptide and tell your skin to start producing fresh collagen, elastin, and other key structural proteins. This helps maintain firmness and reduces the look of fine-lines/wrinkles. GHK is also unique because is also acts as a carrier peptide. It binds to and transports copper ions (forming the complex GHK-Cu). This form has been studied for decades and is known to stimulate wound healing, boost antioxidant defenses, and promote collagen/elastin synthesis. In-vitro studies show both GHK and GHK-CU increase fibroblast activity that enhances the production of collagen, elastin, fibronectin, and other extracellular matrix components. Both of these compounds also help balance enzymes that control collagen breakdown. Human studies (in-vivo) using GHK-Cu creams have reported visible improvements to skin density, elasticity, and wrinkle depth after several weeks of use. A small clinical study also found topical collagen tripeptide improved wrinkle appearance and skin elasticity in women after four weeks. While these results are promising, most research is based on GHK-Cu or its derivatives rather than Tripeptide-1 alone (Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 is a famous derivative of GHK). However, the consensus still supports GHK as a potent skin-signaling molecule that can encourage regeneration and maintain youthful looking skin. Fun fact: GHK is a naturally occurring fragment of type 1 collagen that can be found in human plasma, saliva, and urine.","tags":[{"name":"Peptide","description":"Peptides are the amino-acid chains that help your skin produce proteins such as collagen."},{"name":"Helps with Anti-Aging","description":"Aging skin results from decreased collagen production, sun damage, and slower cell turnover.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/capryloyl-salicylic-acid","name":"Capryloyl Salicylic Acid","description":"Capryloyl Salicylic Acid comes from salicylic acid, the famous acne-fighting BHA. It usually goes by a more common name of LHA, or lipohydroxy acid. Like salicylic acid, this ingredient is a chemical exfoliant that can help break down the oil in your pores and reduce inflammation. Though studies for LHA do show it to be less effective than salicylic acid. To be fair, salicylic acid is the reigning monarch of acne treatments. However, a study from 2009 found LHA to be comparable to BPO, making it a good alternative for people with sensitive skin. Another study of 14 patients found a significant decrease in comedones after using LHA. Another pro of LHA? It is less irritating than salicylic acid due to its large molecule size. Large molecules cannot penetrate skin as well, so they are gentler on the skin. LHA is much less penetrative than salicylic acid. An in-vitro study (not done on a living organism) found only 6% of LHA penetrated past the statum corneum compared to 58% of salicylic acid. An in-vivo (done on a living organism) analysis revealed ~17% of LHA was still present in the top layer of skin after 4 days, versus ~9% of salicylic acid. Interestingly, a study from 2008 found LHA comparable to another famous acid, glycolic acid. This study found about 10% of LHA is as effective as 20-50% of glycolic acid in treating hyperpigmentation and fine-lines. Hydroxy acids have been found to stimulate skin protein, lipids, and thermal thickening. This may have anti-aging benefits.","tags":[{"name":"Exfoliant","description":"Exfoliants help remove dead skin cells and may aid in unclogging pores, smoothing rough skin, and help to increase hydration of skin."},{"name":"Acne Fighter","description":"Some ingredients target acne through different mechanisms: killing bacteria, unclogging pores, or reducing oil production.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/parfum","name":"Parfum","description":"Parfum is a catch-all term for an ingredient or more that is used to give a scent to products. Also called \"fragrance\", this ingredient can be a blend of hundreds of chemicals or plant oils. This means every product with \"fragrance\" or \"parfum\" in the ingredients list is a different mixture. For instance, Habanolide is a proprietary trade name for a specific aroma chemical. When used as a fragrance ingredient in cosmetics, most aroma chemicals fall under the broad labeling category of “FRAGRANCE” or “PARFUM” according to EU and US regulations. The term 'parfum' or 'fragrance' is not regulated in many countries. In many cases, it is up to the brand to define this term. For instance, many brands choose to label themselves as \"fragrance-free\" because they are not using synthetic fragrances. However, their products may still contain ingredients such as essential oils that are considered a fragrance by INCI standards. One example is Calendula flower extract. Calendula is an essential oil that still imparts a scent or 'fragrance'. Depending on the blend, the ingredients in the mixture can cause allergies and sensitivities on the skin. Some ingredients that are known EU allergens include linalool and citronellol. Parfum can also be used to mask or cover an unpleasant scent. The bottom line is: not all fragrances/parfum/ingredients are created equally. If you are worried about fragrances, we recommend taking a closer look at an ingredient. And of course, we always recommend speaking with a professional.","tags":[{"name":"Fragrance","description":"Fragrances make products smell appealing but are a common cause of skin irritation and allergic reactions.

By inhibiting this enzyme, PR can help with skin brightening and lifting dark spots. The manufacturer states 0.5% of PR is more effective than 1% kojic acid.

In small studies, these bacteria seemed to become more common after regular sun exposure, with one strain showing the ability to resist UV light and reduce stress in skin cells. Another study also linked Sphingomonas to smoother and more supple skin. While these results sound promising, the research is still in its early stages, and more studies are needed to know how reliable or meaningful these effects really are. Fun fact: Unlike most microbes, Sphingomonas can survive the wine fermentation process, making it a tiny microbial marker of a wine's unique \"terroir\", or the environment’s “fingerprint” on the wine. Like other ferments, this ingredient may not be Malassezia folliculitis safe.","tags":[{"name":"May feed Fungal Acne","description":"Non-fungal acne-safe products contain ingredients that can worsen fungal acne.

It's made up of four amino acids (glycine, glutamine, proline, and arginine) and palmitic acid (which helps it penetrate skin more effectively). This ingredient helps reduce inflammation by limiting the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a chemical that triggers inflammatory responses, particularly after UV exposure. Less inflammation = slower collagen breakdown and a longer-lasting, youthful appearance. Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7 also stimulates collagen production and supports a healthier skin barrier. Over time, this can improve skin firmness, hydration, and reduce the appearance of fine lines. It’s commonly paired with Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 in the well-known Matrixyl 3000 complex for enhanced anti-aging effects. This ingredient has been shown to be effective and safe in cosmetic use and you'll typically find it in small amounts (less than 0.01%).

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/squalane","name":"Squalane","description":"Squalane is an emollient that helps the skin hold onto moisture. It's an oily liquid that occurs naturally in certain types of fish and plant oils. Because squalane boosts hydration in the skin, it also comes with plenty of benefits: it is an antioxidant and can help fight free radicals and skin damage. Squalane is also found to have a detoxifying effect when applied. Squalane comes from squalene, which occurs naturally within the sebum of our skin. It is one of the oils our skin produces to keep itself hydrated. Squalane is the hydrogenated version of squalene and has a longer shelf life. Research shows that squalane is non-irritating (even at 100% concentration). In general, it's a fantastic ingredient. It does a great job at hydrating the skin, and it's suitable for those with sensitive skin. The source of squalane may impact malassezia / fungal acne. This is because olive oil derived squalane can contain impurities such as fatty acids and plant waxes. Sugarcane derived squalane is recommended for anyone with malassezia concerns. Is squalane vegan? This depends on the source. Squalane can be derived from both plants and animals. Most squalane used in skincare comes from plants. Please note: the source of squalane is only known if disclosed by the brand. We recommend reaching out to the brand if you have any questions about their squalane. Read more about squalene with an \"e\". Is squalane an oil? Squalane is often called an oil, but it’s technically not; it’s a hydrocarbon, meaning it’s only made of carbon and hydrogen, unlike true oils which are triglycerides made of fatty acids and glycerol. The term “oil-free” isn’t regulated, so companies can define it however they want. Some exclude all oils, while others just avoid mineral oil or comedogenic oils. While some people avoid oils thinking they cause breakouts, the right kind of oil (or oil-like ingredient like squalane) can actually help balance and hydrate your skin. It’s worth testing out simple oils or squalane to see what works best for your skin.","tags":[{"name":"Hydrating","description":"Some ingredients help hydrate the skin by either drawing in moisture or preventing it from escaping.

That said, it’s not as powerful as Botox, and research on its long-term effectiveness is still limited. Beyond smoothing, Argireline may also support collagen production. Collagen is the protein that helps keep your skin firm, bouncy, and well-hydrated by strengthening the skin barrier. So while Argireline isn’t a miracle fix, it can be a helpful addition to a routine focused on both prevention and skin health.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide","name":"Zinc Oxide","description":"Zinc Oxide is a mineral broad-spectrum UV filter; it is the broadest UVA and UVB reflector approved by the FDA. It also has skin protectant and skin soothing properties. Zinc oxide is one of the most effective broad-spectrum UV filters. It protects against UVB, UVAII, and UVAI. In comparison to its counterpart titanium dioxide, zinc oxide provides uniform and extended UVA protection. Another great benefit? This ingredient is highly photostable so it won't degrade easily under sunlight. A common myth is that mineral UV filters are widely believed to primarily reflect UV light. However, modern research shows titanium dioxide absorbs UV radiation like chemical filters (~95% absorption & 5% reflection). Zinc oxide has great skin soothing properties so you'll likely find this in sunscreens formulated for sensitive skin or babies/children. It is unlikely to cause \"eye sting\" like other sunscreen ingredients. Regulatory agencies consider zinc oxide to be non-toxic and safe. It has also been shown to not penetrate the skin. Unfortunately, this ingredient does leave a visible white cast. This is why mineral sunscreens are often less cosmetically elegant than chemical or hybrid ones. In cosmetics, zinc oxide can be found in both non-nano and nano-sized forms. The nano version is used to reduce white cast and improve the texture of sunscreen formulas. There are ongoing concerns surrounding nano-zinc oxide's impact on marine ecosystems and whether it can be absorbed into skin. Regarding marine ecosystems and coral reefs, there is no conclusive evidence that any form of zinc oxide (or any other sunscreen ingredients) will cause harm. The science is still developing but many consumers are keeping a close eye on this issue. Please note, many destinations have reef-safety sunscreen rules. For instance, the U.S. Virgin Islands advises all visitors to use non-nano mineral sunscreens. There has also been some stir about whether micronized or nano zinc oxide has potential photoxicity and absorption through the skin/lungs. An in-vitro (done in a test tube or petri dish) study demonstrated micronized zinc oxide to have potential phototoxicity. There's no need to fret; the EU Commission's Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety has stated, \"The relevance of these findings needs to be clarified by appropriate investigations in vivo.\" Or in other words, further studies done on living organisms are needed to prove this. Current research shows zinc oxide nanoparticles do not penetrate intact or sunburned skin. They either remain on the surface or in the outermost layer of dead skin (stratum corneum). Zinc oxide is one of only two classified mineral UV filters with titanium dioxide being the other one. Fun fact: Zinc has been used throughout history as an ingredient in paint and medicine. An Indian text from 500BC is believed to list zinc oxide as a salve for open wound. The Ancient Greek physician Dioscorides has also mentioned the use of zinc as an ointment in 1AD.","tags":[{"name":"UV Protection","description":"UV (Ultraviolet) ray exposure from the sun leads to skin damage; the main types of UV rays are: UV-A and UV-B."},{"name":"Mineral UV Filter","description":"Mineral UV filters, also known as physical or inorganic filters, use naturally occurring minerals such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to create a protective barrier on the skin that reflects and scatters UV rays."},{"name":"Acne Fighter","description":"Some ingredients target acne through different mechanisms: killing bacteria, unclogging pores, or reducing oil production.

{"url":"https://skinsort.com/ingredients/malic-acid","name":"Malic Acid","description":"Malic Acid is an acid with both AHA and BHA properties, but is considered an AHA because its AHA properties are stronger. It can be naturally found in unripe fruit and especially apples (its name from the latin word \"malum\", meaning apple!).

Though it’s considered milder and less potent than glycolic or lactic acid, it can help improve: Due to its larger molecular structure, it penetrates the skin more slowly and is often used in combination with other AHAs to enhance their overall effectiveness. Malic acid often plays a role in balancing a product’s pH and is usually included in small amounts (around 1-2%) as a supporting exfoliant. As with all exfoliating acids, you should wear sunscreen daily when using malic acid to protect your newly resurfaced skin. Fun fact: Malic acid is the compound responsible for the tart flavor of apples and other sour fruits.
