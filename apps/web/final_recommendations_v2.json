  "reasoning": "**Step 1: Audit and Strategy Alignment**\nMy primary task is to execute the Skincare Philosophy. I audited the product list to find candidates for each of the `key_ingredients_to_target`. The philosophy calls for a multi-pronged attack on pigmentation (Vitamin C, Retinoid, Tranexamic Acid), pores (BHA, Retinoid), and under-eye concerns (Retinoid, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid), all while supporting the skin barrier (Ceramides, Hyaluronic Acid). I noted a lack of a dedicated leave-on Tranexamic Acid serum, so I compensated by selecting a sunscreen that includes it, ensuring the ingredient is still present in a meaningful way.\n\n**Step 2: AM Routine Construction - \"Protect, Brighten & Hydrate\"**\nThe AM routine is focused on protection and brightening.\n- **Cleanser:** I chose the `dr-althea/amino-acid-gentle-bubble-cleanser` because it is gentle and contains Ceramides and Hyaluronic Acid, aligning with the philosophy of avoiding stripping cleansers and supporting the barrier.\n- **Brightening Step:** The philosophy requires Vitamin C. The `needly/vita-c-glow-jelly-pad` was selected to function as the morning antioxidant step, delivering Vitamin C and Niacinamide to target pigmentation.\n- **Eye Cream (AM):** To address under-eye concerns without using harsh actives in the morning, I selected the `cosrx/advanced-snail-peptide-eye-cream` for its hydrating and firming benefits from Niacinamide and Peptides.\n- **Moisturizer:** I selected the `purito/b5-panthenol-re-barrier-cream` for both AM and PM. Its focus on barrier repair with Niacinamide, Peptides, and Hyaluronic Acid makes it perfect for supporting the skin, especially given the use of strong actives in the PM.\n- **Sunscreen:** This is the most critical step for pigmentation. The `celimax/pore-dark-spot-brightening-care-sunscreen-spf-50` was the ideal choice. It not only provides high SPF protection but also contains Tranexamic Acid and Niacinamide, directly treating pigmentation as per the philosophy.\n\n**Step 3: PM Routine Construction - \"Treat Pigmentation & Renew Texture\" with Skin Cycling**\nThe PM routine is built around alternating active ingredients to maximize efficacy and minimize irritation, a core clinical safety principle.\n- **Cleanser:** I reused the gentle `dr-althea` cleanser. For users of heavy makeup or sunscreen, an optional first cleanse with the `plum-goodness` balm is included.\n- **Night A (Exfoliation):** To address clogged pores, the philosophy calls for BHA. The `axis-y/mugwort-pore-clarifying-wash-off-pack` was chosen as the dedicated exfoliant. Its wash-off format provides a potent, targeted treatment for pores without the potential irritation of a daily leave-on acid, making it safer to use in a routine with a retinoid.\n- **Night B (Renewal):** The Retinoid is the cornerstone of the PM routine. The `cerave/resurfacing-retinol-serum` was selected because it combines a Retinoid with barrier-supporting Ceramides and Niacinamide, perfectly aligning with the philosophy's strategy of using potent actives alongside ingredients that ensure skin tolerance.\n- **Eye Cream (PM):** The under-eye area is a primary concern requiring a targeted treatment. The `k-secret/seoul-1988-eye-cream-retinal-liposome-4-fermented-bean` was chosen for its powerful Retinal (a type of Retinoid), which is highly effective for anti-aging and pigmentation. This adheres to the safety rule allowing a dedicated eye retinoid in addition to a facial one.\n- **Recovery Nights:** The schedule explicitly includes nights with no actives (Exfoliant or Retinoid) to allow the skin to repair and rebuild its barrier, a critical component of a sustainable, long-term skincare routine.\n\n**Step 4: Final Safety and Cohesion Review**\nI cross-referenced the final routine against all clinical safety rules. The Retinoid and BHA are on separate nights, preventing interaction. Vitamin C is in the AM, and Retinoids are in the PM. Product selections are from the provided list and match the required ingredients. The routine is cohesive, reusing key products like the cleanser and moisturizer to create a streamlined and effective plan that faithfully executes the strategic skincare philosophy.",
