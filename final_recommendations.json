  "reasoning": "1.  **Audit & Philosophy Alignment:** The provided `SkincarePhilosophy` requires a Retinoid, BHA, Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Peptides, and Hyaluronic Acid. The product list contains excellent candidates for each of these, allowing for a complete routine. The primary goals are fading pigmentation, clearing pores, and improving texture.\n\n2.  **Hero Product Selection & Safety Check:**\n    *   **Retinoid (PM):** To address pigmentation, fine lines, and texture, I selected `cerave/resurfacing-retinol-serum`. It contains a retinoid, niacinamide, and ceramides, making it a powerful, multi-benefit product for the PM routine.\n    *   **Safety Rule Adherence (CRITICAL):** The previous attempt violated the rule of using only ONE retinoid product. I have corrected this by selecting the CeraVe serum for the face and choosing a *non-retinoid* eye cream (`cosrx/advanced-snail-peptide-eye-cream`). This ensures the routine is safe and effective without causing excessive irritation.\n    *   **Exfoliant (PM):** To address the \"Pores\" concern, a BHA is needed. The provided list lacks a dedicated BHA serum or toner. The best available alternative is the `axis-y/mugwort-pore-clarifying-wash-off-pack`. As a clay-based mask, it effectively clarifies pores, directly supporting the goal of clearing congestion in the T-zone.\n    *   **Vitamin C (AM):** For the \"Protect, Brighten, and Hydrate\" AM focus, I chose the `needly/vita-c-glow-jelly-pad`. It delivers Vitamin C and Niacinamide to brighten and provide antioxidant protection, perfectly complementing the sunscreen.\n\n3.  **Implementing Skin Cycling:** The philosophy requires both a retinoid and an exfoliant, which mandates a skin cycling schedule to prevent irritation. I have structured the PM routine to alternate between the exfoliation mask (Night 1), the retinoid serum (Night 2), and recovery nights (Nights 3 & 4). The instructions for each product clearly reflect this schedule.\n\n4.  **Building the Supporting Routine:**\n    *   **Cleanser & Moisturizer:** I selected the `anua/8-hyaluronic-acid-hydrating-gentle-foaming-cleanser` and `purito/b5-panthenol-re-barrier-cream` for use in both AM and PM. They are gentle, hydrating, and focused on barrier support, making them ideal partners for the active treatment steps. Reusing them streamlines the routine.\n    *   **Eye Cream:** The under-eye area is a primary concern. The `cosrx/advanced-snail-peptide-eye-cream` was chosen for its blend of peptides, niacinamide, and snail mucin to hydrate, brighten, and firm the delicate skin without conflicting with the facial retinoid.\n    *   **Sunscreen:** The `round-lab/birch-juice-moisturizing-sunscreen-spf-50` provides high-level, broad-spectrum protection while also hydrating and delivering niacinamide, perfectly aligning with the AM goals.\n\n5.  **Final Polish:** The constructed routine directly follows the philosophy. The AM routine protects and brightens. The PM routine treats, renews, and repairs on an alternating schedule. All product selections are from the provided list, justified by their ingredients and category, and all clinical safety rules have been strictly followed, especially the 'one retinoid' limit.<ctrl95>,routine:{am:[{instructions:\",routine:{am:[{instructions:",
